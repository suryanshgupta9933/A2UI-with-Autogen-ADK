# A2UI (Agent-to-Agent UI) Extension spec v0.10

## Overview

This extension implements the A2UI (Agent-to-Agent UI) spec v0.10, a format for agents to send streaming, interactive user interfaces to clients.

## Extension URI

The URI of this extension is https://a2ui.org/a2a-extension/a2ui/v0.10

This is the only URI accepted for this extension.

## Core concepts

The A2UI extension is built on the following main concepts:

Surfaces: A "Surface" is a distinct, controllable region of the client's UI. The spec uses a surfaceId to direct updates to specific surfaces (e.g., a main content area, a side panel, or a new chat bubble). This allows a single agent stream to manage multiple UI areas independently.

Catalog Definition Document: The a2ui extension is catalog-agnostic. All UI components (e.g., Text, Row, Button) and functions (e.g., required, email) are defined in a separate Catalog Definition Schema. This allows clients and servers to negotiate which catalog to use.

Schemas: The a2ui extension is defined by several primary JSON schemas:

- Catalog Definition Schema: A standard format for defining a library of components and functions.
- Server-to-Client Message List Schema: The core wire format for messages sent from the agent to the client (e.g., updateComponents, updateDataModel).
- Client-to-Server Message List Schema: The core wire format for messages sent from the client to the agent (e.g., action).
- Client Capabilities Schema: The schema for the `a2uiClientCapabilities` object.

Client Capabilities: The client sends its capabilities to the server in an `a2uiClientCapabilities` object. This object is included in the `metadata` field of every A2A `Message` sent from the client to the server. This object allows the client to declare which catalogs it supports.

## Agent Card details

Agents advertise their A2UI capabilities in their AgentCard within the `AgentCapabilities.extensions` list. The `params` object defines the agent's specific UI support.

Example AgentExtension block:

```json
{
  "uri": "https://a2ui.org/a2a-extension/a2ui/v0.10",
  "description": "Ability to render A2UI v0.10",
  "required": false,
  "params": {
    "supportedCatalogIds": [
      "https://a2ui.org/specification/v0_10/standard_catalog.json",
      "https://my-company.com/a2ui/v0_1/my_custom_catalog.json"
    ],
    "acceptsInlineCatalogs": true
  }
}
```

### Parameter definitions
- `params.supportedCatalogIds`: (OPTIONAL) An array of strings, where each string is a URI pointing to a Catalog Definition Schema that the agent can generate.
- `params.acceptsInlineCatalogs`: (OPTIONAL) A boolean indicating if the agent can accept an `inlineCatalogs` array in the client's `a2uiClientCapabilities`. If omitted, this defaults to `false`.

## Extension activation
Clients indicate their desire to use the A2UI extension by specifying it via the transport-defined A2A extension activation mechanism.

For JSON-RPC and HTTP transports, this is indicated via the X-A2A-Extensions HTTP header.

For gRPC, this is indicated via the X-A2A-Extensions metadata value.

Activating this extension implies that the server can send A2UI-specific messages (like updateComponents) and the client is expected to send A2UI-specific events (like action).

## Data encoding

A2UI messages are encoded as an A2A `DataPart`.

To identify a `DataPart` as containing A2UI data, it must have the following metadata:

- `mimeType`: `application/json+a2ui`

The `data` field of the `DataPart` contains a **list** of A2UI JSON messages (e.g., `createSurface`, `updateComponents`, `action`). It MUST be an array of messages.

### Processing Rules

The `data` field contains a list of messages. This list is **NOT** a transactional unit. Receivers (both Clients and Agents) MUST process messages in the list sequentially.

If a single message in the list fails to validate or apply (e.g., due to a schema violation or invalid reference), the receiver SHOULD report/log the error for that specific message and MUST continue processing the remaining messages in the list.

Atomicity is guaranteed only at the **individual message** level. However, for a better user experience, a renderer SHOULD NOT repaint the UI until all messages in the list have been processed. This prevents intermediate states from flickering to the user.

### Server-to-client messages

When an agent sends a message to a client (or another agent acting as a client/renderer), the `data` payload must validate against the **Server-to-Client Message List Schema**.

Example DataPart:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "version": "v0.10",
      "createSurface": {
        "surfaceId": "example_surface",
        "catalogId": "https://a2ui.org/specification/v0_10/standard_catalog.json"
      }
    },
    {
      "version": "v0.10",
      "updateComponents": {
        "surfaceId": "example_surface",
        "components": [
          {
            "component": "Text",
            "id": "root",
            "text": "Hello!"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ],
  "kind": "data",
  "metadata": {
    "mimeType": "application/json+a2ui"
  }
}
```

### Client-to-server events

When a client (or an agent forwarding an event) sends a message to an agent, it also uses a `DataPart` with the same `application/json+a2ui` MIME type. However, the `data` payload must validate against the **Client-to-Server Message List Schema**.

Example `action` DataPart:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "version": "v0.10",
      "action": {
        "name": "submit_form",
        "surfaceId": "contact_form_1",
        "sourceComponentId": "submit_button",
        "timestamp": "2026-01-15T12:00:00Z",
        "context": {
          "email": "user@example.com"
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "kind": "data",
  "metadata": {
    "mimeType": "application/json+a2ui"
  }
}
```
